### Dependencies

- numpy==1.16.2
- pandas==0.24.2
- scikit-learn==0.20.3
- tensorflow==1.15.2
- plotly==3.10.0
- econml==0.4
- optuna==0.19.0

### Running the code

To run the simulation with IHDP data, navigate to the `src/` directory and run the command

```
python main.py\
  --iters 100\
  --n_trials 100\
  --alpha_list 100 50 10 5 1 0.5 0.1 0.05 0.01
```

This will run semi-synthetic experiments (model selection and hyper-parameter tuning) conducted in Section 5 of the paper.
